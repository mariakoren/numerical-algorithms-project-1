# numerical-algorithms-project-1

This project was a task for the university subject "Algorytmy Numeryczne".

The task was to calculate the number &pi; in different ways:

1) by the Monte Carlo method
2) the sum of vectors of a regular inscribed n-square

Moreover verifying some hypotheses connecting with their algorithms.
